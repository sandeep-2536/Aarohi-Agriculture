🌾 AAROHI – A Voice-First Digital Agriculture Platform

AAROHI is a farmer-centric, voice-first agriculture platform designed to make technology truly accessible for rural communities. Built with simplicity and inclusiveness in mind, AAROHI allows farmers to navigate the platform using voice commands in Kannada, Hindi, or English, removing language and literacy barriers.

The platform brings together community discussions, real-time group chat, crop and animal selling, stock availability of agricultural inputs, and tele-veterinary video consultations—all under one roof. Farmers can share problems, learn from others, connect with experts, and take informed decisions without dealing with complex interfaces or technical jargon.

AAROHI is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, EJS, Socket.IO, and WebRTC, following a clean MVC architecture. It focuses on real-world usability, farmer-friendly UI, large buttons, voice guidance, and multilingual support to ensure ease of use even for first-time smartphone users.

This project aims to bridge the gap between farmers, information, markets, and experts by turning technology into a helpful companion rather than a hurdle.
